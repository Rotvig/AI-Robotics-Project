The Proportional-, Integral- and Derivative(PID)-controller can be used for motion and error correction. An example of a feedback loop with error correction is shown in figure \ref{fig:PID_Circuit}.

PID can be used for motion correction such as correcting the steering of a car. For example if the error is defined as the crosstrack error which means how far the car is off the intended course. The PID controller can then be feed with the error, and the different parts of the PID controller can then adjust the control signal which affects the steering of the car. 


\section{Proportional-, Integral- and Derivative(PID)-controller}
There are three parts in the PID controller. First there is the Proportional part.
The proportional part is calculated by: Kp*CurrentError. The result of this is shown in figure \ref{fig:prop}.
\myFigure{Theory/PID/proportional}{Proportional part of PID.}{fig:prop}{0.5}

As figure \ref{fig:prop} shows by only having the proportional part the curve will be marginally stable. This result in an oscillation.

Too compensate for oscillation the derivative part is added. The derivative part can also be helpful against overshooting. This is seen in figure \ref{fig:derivative}.

In figure \ref{fig:derivative} the "PD controller" curve gets to the correct course faster than the "P controller" curve does. The derivative part is calculated by: Kd*(CurrentError - PreviousError).

But is the PD controller enough ? No. An example would be if there is a systematic bias. This can result in an constant offset. The PD controller alone cannot compensate for this offset. 

That is why the integral part is needed. 

Figure \ref{fig:integral} shows that the integral will overtime compensate for this offset.

The integral part is calculated by: (Summation of errors)*Ki. 

In figure \ref{fig:pid_calc} the calculation for the output u can be seen. This calculation are with all three part proportional, integral and derivative.

In figure \ref{fig:pid_calc} all three gains are shown {Kp, Ki, Kd} and the error and time are also used to calculate the control signal u.

\section{PID Tuning}

Their are many ways of tuning a PID controller. Two of them are Twiddle and Ziegler-Nichols.
Twiddle is hill climbing algorithm. it works by trial and error. The problem with this is that it typically finds the local minima, and not the global minima. 

Ziegler-Nichols works by initially Ki and Kd are set to zero. Then Kp is raised until oscillation appears. Then Kc is set to value of Kp and Tc is the period of the oscillation. When Kc and Tc are found the table in figure \ref{fig:zig} can be used to get Kp, Ti and Td.

The problem with Ziegler-Nichols is that it gives an aggressive gain and overshoot. 

Tuning a PID controller will always depend on the application. Which makes it difficult to generalize the solution of tuning a PID controller.
