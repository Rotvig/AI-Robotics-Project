\label{sec:sensorControl}

It has been decided to mount two different distance measurement sensors on the robot.
The first is a sonar sensor measuring distance by the reflection of high frequency sound waves on objects, and the second is an infra red sensor doing the same thing, but with light instead.
In the documentation of the sensors its stated that the sonar sensor have a longer reach of about 1.5 meters, to the ca. 50 cm for the infra red sensor.
The infra red sensor on the other hand should be more precise at short distances.
The idea is to combine these two sensors and both get the benefits of the long range, and the short distance precision.
