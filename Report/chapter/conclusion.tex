\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chp:conc}

In this project the theory from the Udacity course Artificial Intelligence for Robotics\footnote{\url{https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373}} was used. The course consisted of six main topics which all are elaborated in part \ref{part:one}, Theory. The theory in the course is used to develop a self driving lego robot. The idea was to place the lego robot at a random position in a known world. The lego robot then have to locate itself in the known map and drive to the goal position.

The project has been a great success. There are some improvement which could improve the project such as the estimation of the lego robot's position. But as the project is now it works as intended.
