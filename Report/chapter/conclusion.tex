\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chp:conc}

In this project the theory from the Udacity course Artificial Intelligence for Robotics\footnote{\url{https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373}} was used. The course consisted of six main topics which all are elaborated in part \ref{part:one}, Theory. The theory in the course is used to develop a self driving lego robot. The idea was to place the lego robot at a random position in a known world. The lego robot then have to locate itself in the known map and drive to the goal position.

The actual theory used to achieve a self driving robot are, particle filter, A*, PID-Controller and sensor fusion.

everything was implemented with success, but the infrared sensor which was used with sonar sensor did not work as expected. The decision was to exclude the infrared sensor and only use the sonar sensor.

The project has been a great success. There are some improvement which could improve the project such as the estimation of the lego robot's position. But as the project is now it works as intended.
