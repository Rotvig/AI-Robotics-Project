\section{A* search algorithm}

The A* search algorithm has been used in this project to find a route to the goal. 

The input to the algorithm is a matrix which consist of areas where  can go and not go. The matrix also contains the information of the robots' position, and a goal for the robot.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={An example of the matrix which the A* uses as input.}, label=a_star]
char[,] matrix = new char[,] {{'-', 'S', '-', '-', 'X'},
							  {'-', 'X', '-', 'X', '-'},
							  {'-', '-', 'X', '-', 'X'},
							  {'X', '-', 'X', 'E', '-'},
							  {'-', '-', '-', '-', 'X'}};
\end{lstlisting}

In listing \ref{a_star} the 'X's marks places the robot can not move through. The 'S' is the position of the robot, and 'E' is the goal. The array itself is a multidimensional char array.
