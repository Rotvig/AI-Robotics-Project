\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:intro}

This report is a result of the project work performed as part of the reading course \emph{AI in Robotics} presented by Department of Engineering at Aarhus University.
The course follows the Udacity course \emph{Artificial Intelligence in Robotics}, while using the book \emph{Probabilistic Robotics} \citep{AIbook} as supplementary theory coverage.\\\\
The first part of this report covers the concepts and theory introduced in the course.
The second part describes how the theory was applied in practice, such that a robot was capable of localizing its own position in a predefined map and drive to a predefined goal position.\\\\
The robot used in the project was build from a LEGO Mindstorms EV3, as seen in figure \ref{fig:legoRob}.
